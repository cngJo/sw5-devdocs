## Profile Page

With an existing b2b account you can access your profile page by pressing on your own name.
Here you can change your account password. Additionally you have access to the order lists if your account
have the required permissions.

### Profile Avatar

You are able to upload your own profile picture (Square). If you don't setup a picture we use [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com) 
as a fallback. If you would like to change your fallback avatar you have to define the avatar on [gravatar.com](http://gravatar.com)
