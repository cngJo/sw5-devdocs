### Registration

As a b2b debtor, a special account is required to interact as partner. If you don't have an
active debtor account you can create a new one by filling out the registration form.
This account is the administrator for all data.

### Request for Account activation

After you have submitted the registration form the shop owner has to activate your account.
Furthermore he has to flag your new b2b account as a debtor account to grant you all necessary privileges.
