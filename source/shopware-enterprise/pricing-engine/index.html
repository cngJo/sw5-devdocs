<h1>Pricing Engine</h1>
<p>
    You can individually customise your price lists with numerous rules, which can include criteria such as delivery country, customer group, currency, shop, or customer stream. The Pricing Engine enables a seamless connection with your existing ERP or PIM systems and optimises performance through batch processing.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

The Pricing Engine provides different features. The prices can be stored as gross prices and supports quantity prices. Furthermore the prices can have a datetime validity. At least it is possible to use calculation terms based on product properties instead of using normal prices.
<br><br>
As an example: (%height% * %width% * %length%) * 0.1
<br><br>
All prices are stored in pricelists. The pricelists can have context based conditions like Shippingcountry, Shop, Customer, Customergroup, Customerstream and Currency. If all conditions fits the prices from the list will override the default prices from the specific shop.
